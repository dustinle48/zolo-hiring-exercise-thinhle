## 2. My Choice

I chose **frontend** exercise because:

- I consider myself as 60-40, 60 with **frontend**, which means it is my strongest asset.
- I also did read the **backend** exercise, but I feel like I could express my whole idea more with the **frontend**, although I'm willing to try the **backend** later as well.

## 3. My product

When I first read the exercise, I immediately thought of a Hiring and Employment Data Analyst Platform, where:

- Employers can create their own organizations and job postings. They also can create offers for particular employees within the platform. Moreover, they can upload data and visualize them using built-in tools. Last but not least, they can also search for candidates as LinkedIn works.
- Employees need to create accounts to keep track of their employment process. When they are offered, they can view the offers and ask for details or even request changes. They can also create their own profiles for employers to find them.
